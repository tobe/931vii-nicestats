# 931vii-nicestats

Pulls data from the router (used dynamic dns) via a cronjob python script `worker.py`, stores it into the db.  
And you get a nice detailed stats of your copper DSL connection over the time :)  

For me tho the stats were kinda boring, as I was wired on a FTTC node so whatever.  
Was still a fun project to hack on. And rooting the router too ;) (private)

An ancient version of this can be seen at `api.infy.cybershade.org`.
